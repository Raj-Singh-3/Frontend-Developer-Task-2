# Frontend Development Task: Build an Interactive Tour and Travel Website

## Objective
Create a **fully interactive, animated, and modern Tour and Travel website** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, and additional frontend technologies. The website should be engaging, visually appealing, and user-friendly, with a focus on showcasing travel destinations, tour packages, booking forms, and user reviews. The project aims to teach students how to combine multiple frontend technologies, implement animations, and create a professional-grade website.

**Note**: Submitting a basic or generic template-based website will not be accepted. The website must demonstrate creativity, interactivity, and a polished user experience with custom animations.

## Task Requirements

### 1. Website Features
The website must include the following pages and features:

- **Homepage**:
  - A hero section with a full-screen background image or video showcasing a travel destination.
  - Animated text or elements (e.g., fading titles, sliding images, or parallax effects).
  - A search bar to filter destinations or tour packages.
  - Featured destinations or tour packages with cards that include hover animations.
  - A call-to-action (CTA) button for booking or exploring more.

- **Destinations Page**:
  - A grid or carousel of travel destinations with images, titles, and short descriptions.
  - Filters for categories (e.g., Adventure, Beach, Cultural, Urban) with smooth transitions.
  - Interactive map integration (e.g., using Google Maps API or a static map with hover effects).

- **Tour Packages Page**:
  - A list of tour packages with details (price, duration, itinerary, inclusions).
  - Sorting and filtering options (e.g., by price, duration, or popularity).
  - Hover effects on package cards and a "Book Optics" button for more details.

- **Booking Form Page**:
  - A form to book a tour package, including fields for name, email, travel date, and package selection.
  - Form validation using JavaScript/React.
  - Animated confirmation message or modal upon form submission.

- **About Us Page**:
  - Information about the travel agency with a timeline or animated infographic of milestones.
  - Team member profiles with hover effects or flip animations.

  - Animated submission feedback (e.g., a success animation or loading spinner).
  - Contact details (phone, email, address) with icons and hover effects.

- **Testimonials/Reviews Section**:
  - A carousel or grid of user reviews with star ratings and animated transitions.
  - Option to submit a review with a simple form.

### 2. Technical Requirements
- **Technologies to Use**:
  - **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
  - **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsiveness.
  - **JavaScript**: For interactivity (e.g., form validation, filters, carousels).
  - **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive layouts, grids, and components (e.g., navbar, modals).
  - **React**: For building reusable components, managing state, and handling dynamic content.
  - **Additional Libraries** (choose at least two):
    - **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: For advanced animations (e.g., scroll-triggered animations, morphing effects).
    - **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**: For scroll-based animations.
    - **Framer Motion**: For React-specific animations.
    - **Swiper.js**: For carousels and sliders.
    - **React Router**: For navigation between pages.
    - **Axios or Fetch API**: For fetching mock data (e.g., destinations or packages from a JSON file).
    - **React Hook Form**: For form handling and validation.
    - **Styled Components or Emotion**: For CSS-in-JS styling in React.

- **Animations**:
  - Use CSS animations or GSAP/Framer Motion for:
    - Fading or sliding hero section elements.
    - Hover effects on cards (e.g., scale, shadow, or image zoom).
    - Scroll-triggered animations for sections (e.g., fade-in, slide-up).
    - Smooth transitions for filters, modals, or carousels.
  - Ensure animations are performant and not excessive to maintain a good user experience.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - Use Bootstrap’s grid system and media queries to ensure the website is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
  - Test responsiveness using browser dev tools or real devices.

- **Interactivity**:
  - Implement dynamic filtering/sorting for destinations and packages.
  - Add form validation with error messages and success animations.
  - Include interactive elements like collapsible sections, modals, or tooltips.

- **Assets**:
  - Use high-quality images from free sources like Unsplash or Pexels.
  - Include icons (e.g., Font Awesome, Material Icons, or React Icons).
  - Optionally, use a mock API or JSON file for dynamic data (e.g., destinations, packages).

### 3. Design Guidelines
- **Color Scheme**: Use a travel-inspired palette (e.g., blues, greens, earthy tones) with high contrast for readability.
- **Typography**: Use modern, readable fonts (e.g., Google Fonts: Poppins, Montserrat, or Roboto).
- **Layout**: Clean, modern, and intuitive with clear navigation.
- **Branding**: Create a simple logo or use a placeholder logo for the travel agency.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Ensure proper ARIA labels for interactive elements.
  - Use semantic HTML (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`).
  - Maintain sufficient color contrast and keyboard navigability.

## Tips for Success
- **Plan First**: Sketch wireframes or use tools like Figma to plan the layout.
- **Start Small**: Build the core structure (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) before adding React and animations.
- **Test Early**: Test responsiveness and functionality as you build.
- **Be Creative**: Add unique features like a travel quiz, interactive map, or animated itinerary timeline.
- **Optimize**: Use lazy loading for images, minify CSS/JS, and ensure fast load times.
- **Document**: Comment your code and explain your choices in the README.

---

## Sample Timeline
- **Day 1**: Setup project, create static homepage with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, and design wireframes.
- **Day 3**: Implement React, add components, and set up navigation with React Router.
- **Day 4**: Add interactivity (forms, filters, carousels) and animations (GSAP/Framer Motion).
- **Day 6**: Test, optimize, deploy, and prepare documentation/presentation.
- **15/08/2025 to 22/08/2025**

---

## Example Inspiration
- **Unique Features**: Add a “Travel Quiz” that suggests destinations based on user preferences, a currency converter, or a weather widget for destinations.
- **Animation Ideas**:
  - Hero text fades in with a slight upward motion.
  - Destination cards scale up and show a shadow on hover.
  - Sections fade in as the user scrolls (using AOS or GSAP).
  - A loading spinner or confetti animation on form submission.
- **Avoid**: Generic Bootstrap templates without customization. Add your own styling and animations to stand out.
